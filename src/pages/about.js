            <p>My name is Joey and I am a full-stack web developer. I have a professional certification through the University of Arizona. My programming skills include JavaScript, Node.js and React. I also have experience with MySQL and NoSQL database structures and ORMs, test-driven development, agile working environments and the development lifecycle. When I'm not coding, I am playing with my boisterous cat, Tank and enjoying Southern Arizona's sunny weather.</p>
